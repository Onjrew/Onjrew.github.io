### About Me

Hi there! Welcome to my github page. My name is Andrew and I like to write code. 

I have been developing professionally for several years now, but still find the need to take on personal projects. Occassionally those projects find their way into a git repo and stuffed here.

My earliest (and ugliest) project was a program to cheat at the game Clue. It started at a party where some friends and I were playing Clue. My friend downloaded an app that promised to solve the game for him. It failed miserably. However, after watching that app fail, I was convinced it should be possible to solve the game programmatically. And the [ClueSolver](https://github.com/Onjrew/Clue-Solver) was born. I would love to revisit it soon and rewrite it in Python.

My latest project is actually this page/site itself. I have been looking for a more web-y project for a while now. On top of showcasing some of my projects I'd also like to try out Jekyll's blogging capability.
