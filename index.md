### About Me

Hi there! Welcome to my github page. My name is Andrew and I like to write code. 

I have been writing code professionally since 2013.

My passion is to create performant, robust, well-tested programming solutions. I have a strong interest in clean, maintainable code.

I like to help boost my teammates and contribute to their success while also thriving on their insights and critical feedback.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn and gain experience with new technologies and toolsets. I would love to explore data-intensive challenges.
